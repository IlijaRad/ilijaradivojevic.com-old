Gelp is an application that connects users with local restaurants. The platform allows users to find the crowds favorite restaurants.

The front-end was built using **React**, for CSS I used **Tailwind CSS**, back-end was built made using **Node**, **Express** and **PostgreSQL**.

On the home page of the application you can see a table that lists all the restaurants that were added by users. The table includes CRUD functionality with bulk delete option. It also includes live searching, sorting, pagination which were all built on the front end with the help of npm package called react-data-sort. If you click on the table row for a particular restaurant it navigates to the reviews page where the users can leave reviews for that particular restaurant.

The website is fully responsive and it is maintained by me. I am updating it from time to time, especially when a new major version of npm packages I use gets released or when I come up with new ideas.

The website is not fully *finished* as I'm planning to add a few things such as validation for all of the forms and confirmation pop up modal for deleting table rows.
