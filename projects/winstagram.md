This is a website with a self explanatory title.

The front-end was built using **React**, for CSS I used **Tailwind CSS**, back-end was built using **Firebase**.

The features on the application include login, registration and protected routes with auth. When a user logs in, he gets redirectered to the feed page where he can see the content his followers posted. The user can view, like and comment the posts he sees. On the side the user can see suggested people that he can follow. The user can also open the profiles and view all of the other users posts.

The website is fully responsive and it is maintained by me. I am updating it from time to time, especially when a new major version of npm packages I use gets released or when I come up with new ideas.

The website is not fully *finished* as I'm planning to convert it to typescript and write tests.
