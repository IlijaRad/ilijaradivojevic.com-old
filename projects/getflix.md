The front-end was built using **React**, for CSS I used **Styled Components**, back-end was built using **Firebase**.

The features on the application include login, registration and protected routes with auth. After a user logs in, he can view or search the series and films from the Firebase. The user can filter the content by clicking on 'series' of 'films' tabs and by using the live search. When a user click on a series or a film he gets to see more information about the show such as plot, genre. rating. There is also a play button which plays a placeholder video.

The website is fully responsive and it is maintained by me. I am updating it from time to time, especially when a new major version of npm packages I use gets released or when I come up with new ideas.

The website is not fully *finished* as I'm planning to convert it to typescript and write tests.
